# initialoze PC projections with static pattern - eg. random
# calculate weigts importances by magnituce
# calculate weights importances by activation magnitudes
# copy weights from base model into PC compressor
# freeze weights of base model in PC compressor
# initialize PC projections based on base model weights importances
# prune base model into smaller based on weights importances - copy weights to smaller model

# find out how to utilize base model layer norms weights in PC compressor
